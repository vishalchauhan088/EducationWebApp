        <p><spam class="bold-italic">A regular ordered arrangement of constituent particles in three dimensions is called 
            crystal lattice. </spam></p>
            <h4>Lattice points or lattice sites: 
            </h4>
            <p>The fixed positions on which the constituent particles are present are called lattice points 
                or lattice sites. A group of lattice points which when repeated over and over again in 3 
                dimensions give the complete crystal lattice. </p>
                <h4> Unit cell:</h4>
                <p>It is defined as the smallest repeating unit in space lattice which when repeated over and 
                    over again generates the complete crystal lattice. The crystal can consist of an infinite 
                    number of unit cells. </p>
                    <h4>Parameters which characterize a unit cell: </h4>
                    <p>a. Dimensions of the unit cell along the three edges, a, b and c: 
                        These edges may or may not be mutually perpendicular. </p>
                    <p>b. Inclination of the edges to each other: 
                        This is denoted by the angle between the edges α , β , and respectively. α is the 
                        angle between the edges b and c, β is the angle between the edges a and c, and γ is 
                        the angle between a and b. </p>
                        <h4> Seven crystal systems:</h4>
                        <p>a. Cubic: α = β = γ = 90° , a = b = c</p>
                        <p>b. Tetragonal: α = β = γ = 90° ; a = b ≠ c</p>
                        <p>c. Orthorhombic: α = β = γ = 90°; a ≠ b ≠ c</p>
                        <p>d. Monoclinic: α =γ = 90°, β ≠ 90°; a ≠ b ≠ c </p>
                        <p>e. Hexagonal: α = β = 90°, γ =120°; a = b ≠ c</p>
                        <p>f. Rhombohedral or trigonal: α = β = γ ≠ 90°; a = b = c</p>
                        <p>g. Triclinic: α ≠ β ≠ γ ≠ 90°; a ≠ b ≠ c</p>
