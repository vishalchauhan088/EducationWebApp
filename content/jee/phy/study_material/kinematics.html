                    <p><span class="italic-bold">We can find objects in motion all around us. Even when the person is resting, the heart pumps blood through the veins. There is the motion of atoms and molecules in all the objects. There is motion when the ball is hit by a player with his bat. The branch of classical mechanics that deals with the study of the motion of the points, objects and a group of objects without considering the causes of motion are called Kinematics. The word kinematics came from the Greek word “kinesis”, meaning motion. Kinematics has its application in astrophysics to study the motion of celestial objects. It is also used in robotics, biomechanics to explain the motion of objects with joint parts such as engines, human skeletons, robotic arms and much more.

                        In kinematics, we study the trajectories of the objects, as well as their differential properties like velocity and acceleration.</span>.</p>

                   <p>The position of the object relative to the reference frame has to be described in order to understand the motion of the object. Mathematically, the variable ‘x’ is used to represent the position of the object. The position variable x can be described by making two choices. We can decide where x = 0 has to be put and which direction has to be taken as the positive direction. This is known as choosing the frame of reference or the coordinate system. Therefore, choosing the coordinate system or the set of axes within which the position, orientation and other properties of the object are being measured is called the frame of reference.
