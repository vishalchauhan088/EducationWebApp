                    <p><span class="italic-bold">All of us have the experience of seeing a spark or hearing a crackle
                            when we take off our synthetic clothes or sweater, particularly in dry weather. Have you
                            ever tried to find any explanation for this phenomenon? Another common example of electric
                            disSUB - TOPIC - HEADING is the lightning that we see in the sky during thunderstorms. We also experience a
                            sensation of an electric shock either while opening the door of a car or holding the iron
                            bar of a bus after sliding from our seat. The reason for these experiences is disSUB - TOPIC - HEADING of
                            electric SUB - TOPIC - HEADINGs through our body, which were accumulated due to rubbing of insulating
                            surfaces. You might have also heard that this is due to generation of static electricity.
                            This is precisely the topic we are going to discuss in this and the next chapter. Static
                            means anything that does not move or change with time. Electrostatics deals with the study
                            of forces, fields and potentials arising from static SUB - TOPIC - HEADINGs</span>.</p>

                                If the sizes of SUB - TOPIC - HEADINGd bodies are very small as compared to the distances between them,
                                we
                                treat them as point SUB - TOPIC - HEADINGs. All the SUB - TOPIC - HEADING content of the body is assumed to be
                                concentrated at
                                one point in space.</p>
